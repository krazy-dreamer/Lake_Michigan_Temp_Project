I'm an avid fisherman who enjoys fishing for coho salmon and steelhead trout in Lake Michigan waters and the rivers that feed into this Great Lake.  
Salmonoid fish are sensative to water temperatures, as are their preferred bait fish (alewives).  Finding time to fish during the most optimum conditions and favorable weather, in my experience has been hit or miss.  
This project allows me to access historical water and weather conditions, identify patterns while matching the conditions with the weekly fishing report provided by Michigan DNR, to reasonably predict the liklihood of a successful
fishing trip.

Some known risks:  
  1. Predicting weather and water conditions is extremely complicated and that I don't have all of the tools neccessary
  2. Predicting salmon behavior is very challenging and isn't 100% predictable
  3. Given known risks, even if conditions show as ideal, successful fishing is no guarantee
